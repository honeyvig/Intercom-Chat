===============
The integration of Intercom for Portlandia Electric Supply (PES) requires several modules to ensure that the platform works effectively across their operations. Here's an outline of how you could approach this using Python for implementation, including AI-driven workflows and integrating various systems.
1. Platform Configuration and Role-Based Permissions

    Objective: Role-based access for teams, ensuring secure access.
    Approach: Configure role-based permissions using Intercom’s API. This will ensure that each user (SDRs, AEs, AMs, etc.) has access to only the data they need.
    Python Code: Automate roles and permissions setup with API calls to Intercom.

Example (using Python’s requests library):

import requests

intercom_api_url = 'https://api.intercom.io/roles'
headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    'Accept': 'application/json'
}

def create_role(name, permissions):
    data = {
        "role": {
            "name": name,
            "permissions": permissions
        }
    }
    response = requests.post(intercom_api_url, json=data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
permissions = ['users.read', 'conversations.manage', 'leads.manage']
response = create_role('Account Manager', permissions)
print(response)

2. Custom Bot and NLL Integration with Lifecycle-Based Lead Scoring

    Objective: Implement custom bots to capture and qualify leads using Natural Language Learning (NLL).
    Approach: Use Intercom’s Custom Bots for lead qualification and integrate NLL models to dynamically score leads based on user inputs.
    Python Code: Custom bot setup can be automated using Intercom API to create specific bots based on customer segment.

Example:

def create_custom_bot(trigger, action):
    data = {
        "bot": {
            "trigger": trigger,
            "action": action
        }
    }
    response = requests.post(intercom_api_url, json=data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Example of creating a simple lead qualification bot
trigger = "user_responds"
action = "qualify_lead"
create_custom_bot(trigger, action)

3. Proactive Messaging and Multi-Channel Communication

    Objective: Set up proactive messaging across multiple channels like email, SMS, and chat.
    Approach: Use Intercom’s Messaging API to push messages and engage customers at key moments (e.g., on product or pricing pages).
    Python Code: Configure proactive messages based on customer interactions.

Example:

def send_proactive_message(user_id, message):
    data = {
        "message_type": "inapp",
        "user_id": user_id,
        "body": message
    }
    response = requests.post('https://api.intercom.io/messages', json=data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

send_proactive_message('user_123', 'Hey, we have a special discount on your favorite products!')

4. Help Center and AI-Powered Ticketing System

    Objective: Use AI to prioritize tickets and suggest solutions.
    Approach: Integrate AI-powered ticketing via Intercom’s API to automate ticket triage based on urgency and SLA.

Example:

def create_ticket(user_id, issue_description):
    data = {
        "ticket": {
            "user_id": user_id,
            "description": issue_description,
            "priority": "high"
        }
    }
    response = requests.post('https://api.intercom.io/tickets', json=data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

create_ticket('user_456', 'Unable to access my PES account')

5. Comprehensive Integrations with Salesforce, NetSuite, Asana, and Office 365

    Objective: Sync Intercom with existing PES systems.
    Approach: Use Salesforce API, NetSuite API, Asana API, and Office 365 API to ensure smooth data flow.
    Python Code: You can build integrations to pull data from these systems and push updates to Intercom.

Example for Salesforce Integration:

def sync_salesforce_with_intercom(salesforce_data):
    intercom_data = {
        "user": {
            "email": salesforce_data['email'],
            "name": salesforce_data['name']
        }
    }
    response = requests.post('https://api.intercom.io/users', json=intercom_data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

salesforce_data = {'email': 'customer@example.com', 'name': 'John Doe'}
sync_salesforce_with_intercom(salesforce_data)

6. AI-Driven Drip Campaigns and Lifecycle-Specific Nurturing Sequences

    Objective: Build adaptive, personalized campaigns.
    Approach: Automate drip campaigns using Intercom’s automation rules.
    Python Code: Automate content delivery based on AI-driven insights.

Example:

def create_drip_campaign(user_id, campaign_stage):
    data = {
        "user_id": user_id,
        "campaign_stage": campaign_stage
    }
    response = requests.post('https://api.intercom.io/automated_campaigns', json=data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

create_drip_campaign('user_789', 'Welcome Email')

7. Custom Dashboards and Reporting with AI-Enhanced Analytics

    Objective: Build custom dashboards.
    Approach: Use Intercom’s Reporting API and integrate predictive analytics for at-risk accounts.

Example:

def create_dashboard(user_id, metrics):
    data = {
        "dashboard": {
            "user_id": user_id,
            "metrics": metrics
        }
    }
    response = requests.post('https://api.intercom.io/dashboards', json=data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

create_dashboard('user_123', ['lead_conversion', 'customer_satisfaction'])

8. Predictive Insights, NLL Applications, and Long-Term Account Management

    Objective: Use AI to predict retention and upsell opportunities.
    Approach: Implement NLL-based predictive analytics for account management and renewal.

Example:

def predict_account_risk(user_id):
    # Hypothetical function to predict retention risk based on historical data
    risk_data = {
        "user_id": user_id,
        "predicted_risk": "high"
    }
    response = requests.post('https://api.intercom.io/predictions', json=risk_data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

predict_account_risk('user_001')

Payment and Milestones:

Payment will be based on module completion. For each feature or module (such as Platform Configuration, Custom Bot Setup, etc.), payment can be tied to deliverables.
Implementation Success Metrics:

    Lead Conversion Rate: Aiming for a significant increase in qualified leads through AI-driven processes.
    Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): Targeting a CSAT score of over 85% through streamlined workflows and personalized engagement.
    Support Efficiency: Reducing repetitive inquiries via AI and automating handoffs to human agents for high-value interactions.
    Retention and Upsell: Improving retention and conversion rates using predictive insights for upsell opportunities.

This approach integrates AI-driven workflows within Intercom to optimize customer engagement, support, and revenue generation across Portlandia Electric Supply’s operations.
